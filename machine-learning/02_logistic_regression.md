## what is the odds ratio from logistic regression? can you show some example

The odds ratio is a measure of the association between a predictor variable and an outcome variable in a logistic regression model. It is calculated by exponentiating the coefficient of the predictor variable. For example, if the coefficient of the predictor variable is 0.5, then the odds ratio is 1.73. This means that for every one-unit increase in the predictor variable, the odds of the outcome variable occurring are 73% higher.

Here is an example of how odds ratios can be used to interpret logistic regression models. Suppose we are interested in predicting whether a patient will develop cancer. We run a logistic regression model and find that the coefficient for the predictor variable "age" is 0.5. This means that for every one-year increase in age, the odds of developing cancer are 73% higher.

Odds ratios can be used to make comparisons between different groups. For example, we could compare the odds of developing cancer between men and women. If the odds ratio for gender is 2.0, then this means that women are twice as likely as men to develop cancer.

Odds ratios can also be used to make predictions about individual patients. For example, if a patient is 65 years old, we can use the odds ratio for age to predict that they have a 1.73 times higher odds of developing cancer than a 55-year-old patient.

It is important to note that odds ratios are only estimates of the true association between a predictor variable and an outcome variable. The true association may be different from the estimated association due to chance or other factors.



## how do you calculate odds ratio?

The odds ratio is calculated by dividing the odds of the event occurring in the exposed group by the odds of the event occurring in the non-exposed group. The odds of an event occurring is calculated by dividing the number of people who experienced the event by the number of people who did not experience the event.

For example, suppose we have a study of 100 people, 50 of whom were exposed to a certain factor and 50 of whom were not exposed. Of the 50 exposed people, 20 experienced the event, and of the 50 non-exposed people, 10 experienced the event. The odds of experiencing the event in the exposed group is 20/50 = 0.4, and the odds of experiencing the event in the non-exposed group is 10/50 = 0.2. The odds ratio is 0.4/0.2 = 2.0. This means that people who were exposed to the factor were twice as likely to experience the event as people who were not exposed.

It is important to note that odds ratios can be misleading if the outcome variable is rare. For example, if the event occurs in only 1% of the population, then an odds ratio of 2.0 means that people who are exposed to the factor are twice as likely to experience the event as people who are not exposed. However, this still means that only 2% of people who are exposed to the factor will experience the event.

Odds ratios can also be misleading if the study has a small sample size. For example, if the study only has 100 people, then the odds ratio may be unstable and may not be a reliable estimate of the true association between the predictor variable and the outcome variable.
